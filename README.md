**from [Esri's ArcGIS for Local Government team](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/communities/local-government/)**

The Executive Dashboard is a configuration of ArcGIS Online and a HTML 5 / JavaScript application used by local government leaders to proactively view critical metrics, identify trends, raise questions, and devise new management strategies.  It supports community-wide efforts to increase accountability and transparency within government and with the citizens they serve.   The Dashboard is a single application that can be deployed by local governments and used by decision-makers on a tablet device and desktop PC.
