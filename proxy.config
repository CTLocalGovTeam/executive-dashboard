                <!-- Twitter requires authentication in order to search for tweets. This rule provides OAuth 2
                     authentication for the app. This authentication is a two-step process: the rule asks
                     Twitter for a "bearer token" using credentials defined below, then the proxy is able
                     to use this token to make searches. The proxy caches the bearer token for the period
                     specified below.
                     To generate application-level authentication credentials, go to https://dev.twitter.com/apps
                     and log into your Twitter account. Click on the "Create a new application" button in the
                     upper-right corner. Provide a Name that's unique across Twitter. Provide a Description and
                     Website as you see fit; leave Callback blank. Agree to the rules and fill in the Captcha,
                     then click "Create your Twitter application". Copy the OAuth Consumer key and Consumer secret
                     to the the credentials (below). Click on "Create my access token", then click on it again
                     after the page refreshes. Copy the Access token and Access token secret to the credentials. -->
